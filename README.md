# Algorand-Standard-Asset

Using Stateful Smart Contract To Create Algorand Standard Asset.

‚ö†Ô∏è This project **hasn't been security audited** and should not be used in a production environment.

## Summary
1. Inital Implementation(‚úÖ)
2. Understanding Algorand Standard Assets(ASA)(‚úÖ)

    Using [Algorand Standard Assets (ASA)](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/), one can represent stablecoins, digital art, securities, etc. These are typically created by an Algorand account with a private key however here we do so using a [stateful smart contract](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/apps/) linked to an [escrow account](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/smartsigs/modes/#contract-account). This opens up the door for complex applications where we can use on-chain data to determine ASA parameters
    
    To create an ASA, you would group an application call transaction with an ASA creation transaction using an [atomic transfer](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/atomic_transfers/).

    Similarly to send the ASA from the contract account, (if you require on-chain data) you can group an application call transaction with an asset transfer transaction.
  
3. Stateful Smart Contract and account/escrow account(‚úÖ)

    - We can solve this problem by linking a stateful smart contract to a contract / escrow account . The stateful smart contract stores state that is used to verify the ASA creation parameters and the contract account creates the ASA.

    - All Algorand contracts have a [minimum balance](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/accounts/#minimum-balance) requirement of 100,000 microAlgos, which includes escrow accounts. Therefore, before we can submit any transactions from the escrow account we must first fund it.üôÑ
  
4. Use Goal Commands(‚úÖ)
    - goal app create
    - goal app call
    - goal asset create
    - goal asset send
    - goal clerk group
    - goal clerk split
    - goal clerk sign
    - goal clerk rawsend
    
## Requirements

* Linux or macOS
* Python 3. The scripts assumes the Python executable is called `python3`.
* The [Algorand Node software](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/). A private network is used, hence there is no need to sync up MainNet or TestNet. `goal` is assumed to be in the PATH.

## Setup

To install all required packages, run: 
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

There are a number of bash script files which execute the goal commands for you.

They should be run in the following order:
1. **startnet.sh**: Sets up private network
2. **createapp.sh**: Compiles the PyTeal files to TEAL and deploys the stateful smart contract 
3. **fundescrow.sh**: Send Algos to escrow account
4. **linkapptoescrow.sh**: Adds the escrow address to the application's global state
5. **createasa.sh**: Creates a new ASA from the escrow account
6. **fundasa.sh**: Receive 1 ASA that was created by the escrow account
7. **stopnet.sh**: Delete private network

Note that the scripts assume the application has ID `APP_ID=1`.
In particular, no transactions should be made before calling `createapp.sh`.
